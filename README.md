# Concerts, Bands, and Venues Database Project

This project implements Python classes (`Concert`, `Band`, and `Venue`) that interact with a SQLite database to manage a collection of concerts, bands, and venues. The methods in these classes execute raw SQL queries to retrieve, insert, and manipulate data in the database.

## Features

- **Concert Methods:**
  - `Concert.band()`: Retrieves the Band instance for this concert.
  - `Concert.venue()`: Retrieves the Venue instance for this concert.
  - `Concert.hometown_show()`: Checks if the concert is in the band's hometown.
  - `Concert.introduction()`: Generates an introduction string for the band at the concert.

- **Band Methods:**
  - `Band.concerts()`: Retrieves a collection of all concerts the band has played.
  - `Band.venues()`: Retrieves a collection of all venues the band has performed at.
  - `Band.play_in_venue()`: Creates a new concert for the band at a specified venue and date.
  - `Band.all_introductions()`: Returns an array of introduction strings for all concerts.
  - `Band.most_performances()`: Returns the band that has played the most concerts.

- **Venue Methods:**
  - `Venue.concerts()`: Retrieves a collection of all concerts for the venue.
  - `Venue.bands()`: Retrieves a collection of all bands that performed at the venue.
  - `Venue.concert_on()`: Finds the first concert on a given date at the venue.
  - `Venue.most_frequent_band()`: Returns the band that has performed the most at the venue.

## Project Structure

- **concert_band_venue.py**: Contains the `Concert`, `Band`, and `Venue` classes and the respective methods.
- **test_methods.py**: A script to test the functionalities of the `Concert`, `Band`, and `Venue` classes using test data inserted into the database.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (or PostgreSQL if using psycopg2)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/concerts-bands-venues.git
   cd concerts-bands-venues
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - If you plan to use `sqlite3`, no additional installation is required (it's part of Python standard library).
   - For `psycopg2` (PostgreSQL), install it using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install psycopg2
     ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   Run the script to create the necessary tables (`bands`, `venues`, `concerts`) and insert test data.
   ```bash
   python test_methods.py
   ```

## How to Run the Tests

1. Make sure you have a valid SQLite database file (`music_festival.db` by default) in the same directory or adjust the database path in `test_methods.py`.
2. Run the testing script:
   ```bash
   python test_methods.py
   ```

The script will output test results for the following:
- Concert class methods: `hometown_show()` and `introduction()`.
- Band class methods: `play_in_venue()`, `all_introductions()`, and `most_performances()`.
- Venue class methods: `concert_on()` and `most_frequent_band()`.

## Example Output

```
Testing Concert Methods:
Is it a hometown show?: True
Introduction: Hello New York!!!!! We are The Rockers and we're from New York

Testing Band Methods:
Playing at a new venue...
All Introductions for the band:
Hello New York!!!!! We are The Rockers and we're from New York
Hello Chicago!!!!! We are The Rockers and we're from New York
Band with the most performances:
Band ID: 1, Name: The Rockers, Concerts: 2

Testing Venue Methods:
Concert on 2023-01-01: (1, 'The Rockers', '2023-01-01')
Most frequent band at this venue:
Band ID: 1, Name: The Rockers, Performances: 1
```
